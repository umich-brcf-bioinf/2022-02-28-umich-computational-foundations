## We set the path for the figures globally below, so if we want to
## customize it for individual episodes, we can append a prefix to the
## global path. For instance, if we call knitr_fig_path("01-") in the
## first episode of the lesson, it will generate the figures in
## `fig/rmd-01-`
knitr_fig_path <- function(prefix) {
    new_path <- paste0(opts_chunk$get("fig.path"),
                      prefix)
    opts_chunk$set(fig.path = new_path)
}

## We use the rmd- prefix for the figures generated by the lessons so
## they can be easily identified and deleted by `make clean-rmd`.  The
## working directory when the lessons are generated is the root so the
## figures need to be saved in fig/, but when the site is generated,
## the episodes will be one level down. We fix the path using the
## `fig.process` option.
