## Wrapping up

We hope you now have more familiarity with key concepts, data types, tools, and how they all
connect to enable gene expression analysis from bulk RNA-Seq data.

## Housekeeping

- Please take our optional <a href="https://forms.gle/XcSnsfDMF6hwBJXBA" target="_blank">post-workshop survey</a> (5-10 minutes) <br />

- We will email you a link to the final session recordings by next week.

- The website/notes for this workshop and [UMcoderspaces Slack channel](https://umcoderspaces.slack.com) channel
  will be available.

## Looking ahead

#### Workshop environment
- BASH/RStudio workshop compute environment will be available until next Monday.
- You can download files from the workshop environment from your terminal/command line window as below.
  (You will need to substitute your actual workshop username and type workshop password when prompted.)
  ```
  mkdir 2021-11-15-rnaseq-demystified-workshop
  scp -r YOUR_USERNAME@bfx-workshop01.med.umich.edu:"data analysis *-umich-rnaseq-demystified" 2021-11-15-rnaseq-demystified-workshop
  ```
  - Note that the full download is about 2Gb, so depending on your internet
    speeds it could take while.

#### Installing software locally
  - You can install necessary programs to run programs locally. Note
    that for typical data, the compute intensive steps (Day 1) assume your
    computer has powerful compute (many CPUs and lots of RAM) and sizable
    storage capacity. (i.e. It may not be practical to run these on your laptop.)
  - Installing bioinformatics software is non-trivial and comprehensive instructions
    to setup a complete compute environment are outside the scope of this workshop.
    (We are considering offering a Computational Reproducibility workshop that
    would cover this.) For the intrepid, see relevant links below:
    - [Installing Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation)
    - [Conda environment YAML](https://github.com/umich-brcf-bioinf/2021-11-15-umich-rnaseq-demystified/blob/master/server_setup/conda_setup/workshop-rsd.yaml)
    - [Setting up R/R-Studio](workshop_setup/setup_instructions_advanced.html)

#### _Great Lakes_ at University of Michigan
- Advanced Research Computing (ARC) at University of Michigan hosts a
  high-performance computing (HPC) platform called _Great Lakes_ which combines
  high-end computers, fast/resilient storage, and pre-installed software.
  GreatLakes may be a good resource for folks who need to run the more compute
  intensive steps and a substantial block of compute and storage is subsidized
  by ARC making it essentially free to many researchers.
  - About <a href="https://arc.umich.edu/greatlakes/" target="_blank">Great Lakes HPC</a>.
  - About the ARC <a href="https://arc.umich.edu/umrcp/" target="_blank">Research Computing Package</a>.
  - Videos on <a href="https://www.mivideo.it.umich.edu/channel/ARC-TS%2BTraining/181860561/" target="_blank">getting started with Great Lakes</a>. (available to UM folks)
  - Upcoming <a href="https://arc.umich.edu/events/" target="_blank">ARC workshops</a>.

#### Training and support
  - Learning bioinformatic analyses more like a process than a task. Resources
    to consider:
    - UM Bioinformatics Core links to <a href="https://brcf.medicine.umich.edu/cores/bioinformatics-core/training/" target="_blank">training resources/workshops</a>
    - <a href="https://umcoderspaces.slack.com" target="_blank">UM CoderSpaces Slack</a> and <a href="https://datascience.isr.umich.edu/events/coderspaces/" target="_blank">UM CoderSpaces "office hours"</a>.
    - For intro lessons and workshops in Bash / Git / R / Python : <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/" target="_blank">Software Carpentry</a> and the <a href="https://umcarpentries.org/" target="_blank">UM Software Carpentry Group</a>.
    - For more info on NGS analysis, we can highly recommend training materials from the <a href="https://hbctraining.github.io/main/" target="_blank">Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core</a>.
