The Bioinf Core Workshop Team is pleased to host two upcoming workshops:

### **Computational Foundations: 2/28-3/2, 9am-1pm ET**  
### **RNA-Seq Demystified: 3/14-3/16, 9am-1pm ET**

<br/> 

* Composed of the two workshops, the 6 x 1/2-day series is targeted toward researchers who would like to better understand the analysis of  differential gene expression in bulk RNA-Seq data. 
* The cost is $250/seat for both workshops. Registration at <a href= target"_blank">EventBrite</a>.
* The workshop is entirely online and will be conducted over Zoom/Slack.
* The series assumes basic knowledge of genetics but no previous coding/programming experience in necessary.
* By the end of the workshop series, attendees will be able to:
  * Use the command line and R to navigate, analyze, and visualize data files.
  * Transform raw sequencing data into annotated differential expression values using a suite of open-source tools.
  * Visualize and interpret common data quality problems and understand their impact and possible mitigations.


### More details:

* Attendees will use their own workstation/laptop to participate in the workshop and access the shared server environment;  the workstation/laptop should have a microphone, camera, and reliable internet access.  We will provide detailed setup instructions (including logins for Zoom and Slack) and other assistance in advance of the workshop. 
* We will provide a server environment and a login, sample data, and required software.  
* The workshop experience is designed to be interactive and includes live-coding and opportunities for questions throughout. The workshop will be recorded and the recordings will be made available to those who attend the workshop.
