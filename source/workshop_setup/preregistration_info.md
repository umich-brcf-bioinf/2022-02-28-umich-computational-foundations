The Bioinf Core Workshop Team is pleased to host two upcoming workshops:

### **<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/computational-foundations-a-virtual-3-day-workshop-from-um-bioinfcore-tickets-243060649947" target="_blank">2/28-3/2, 9am-1pm ET: Computational Foundations</a>**  
### **<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rna-seq-demystified-a-virtual-3-day-workshop-from-um-bionfcore-tickets-243028162777" target="_blank">3/14-3/16, 9am-1pm ET: RNA-Seq Demystified</a>**

<br/> 

* Composed of the two complementary workshops, this workshop series is targeted toward researchers who would like to better understand the analysis of  differential gene expression in bulk RNA-Seq data. 
* The workshop is entirely online and will be conducted over Zoom and Slack.
* The series assumes basic knowledge of genetics but no previous coding/programming experience is necessary.
* The cost is $250/seat for the entire two-workshop series. While it is possible to register for a single workshop, we recommend that you attend both. When you enroll in the RNA-Seq Demystified workshop, you can request to be automatically registered for Computational Foundations. Register at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rna-seq-demystified-a-virtual-3-day-workshop-from-um-bionfcore-tickets-243028162777" target="_blank">EventBrite</a>. *(The Computational Foundations is free of charge; however please note that: 1) registration precedence is given to RNA-Seq Demystified attendees and 2) general admission registration for Computational Foundations opens later in Feburary.)*


### More details:

* By the end of the workshop series, attendees will be able to:
  * Use the command line and R to navigate, analyze, and visualize data files.
  * Transform raw sequencing data into annotated differential expression values using a suite of open-source tools.
  * Visualize and interpret common data quality problems and understand their impact and possible mitigations.
* Attendees will use their own workstation/laptop to participate in the workshop and access the shared server environment;  the workstation/laptop should have a microphone, camera, and reliable internet access.  We will provide detailed setup instructions (including logins for Zoom and Slack) and other assistance in advance of the workshop. 
* We will provide a server environment and a login, sample data, and required software.  
* The workshop experience is designed to be interactive and includes live-coding and opportunities for questions throughout. The workshop will be recorded and the recordings will be made available to those who attend the workshop.
